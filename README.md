## üå± Woody - Smart Farming App
Introducing Woody, your ultimate solution for upgrading basic container greenhouses into smart farms.

With Woody, fleet owners can easily keep tabs on all their containers, worry-free about fleet security. Meanwhile, farm technicians can conveniently manage plants from outside the container, thanks to various monitoring sensors and controls that can adjust environmental conditions.

Our goal is to make it easier than ever to grow your crops in a smarter way!

Woody uses a seeed reTerminal to take sensor readings and control the container. The plant system includes a water level sensor, soil moisture sensor, RGB Led Stick, cooling fan and temperature and humidity sensor. The container always has geolocation so that you can easily track your container's location. This system includes a GPS and accelerometer. Besides geolocation, we also want the container to be secure, with a motion sensor, buzzer, door sensor, door lock and sound sensor you don't have to worry about security.

We wanted Woody to be practical which is why besides all the hardware we developed a .NET MAUI mobile app. The app allows you to create an account as a technician or fleet owner and view sensor readings and have access to control panels for your container.

## ü§ù Contributions
|Team Member|Contributions|
|-----------|-------------|
| Diana| Plant Subsystem, UI Design and Polish|
| Noah | Security Subsystem, Azure Cloud Integration Python, Azure Portal Setup|
| Cindy | Geolocation Subsystem, Azure Cloud Integration C#, Firebase & Azure Portal Setup |

Diana created the scripts for all plant subsystem hardware and the controller. She also prepared the UI mockups and implemented them in our app, along with the UI polish. Cindy and I worked on the Azure Cloud Integration (researching and creating Azure resources), with Cindy focusing on the C# side and I on the Python side. Cindy also worked on the geolocation subsystem, and I worked on the security subsystem. Cindy also set up the Firebase and authentication for our project.

## üì± Mobile App
The Woody app revolutionizes traditional container farming by integrating smart technology to enhance efficiency and security. Designed for both fleet owners and farm technicians, this application leverages sensors and cloud integration to monitor and control environmental conditions within container greenhouses remotely. Key features include real-time notifications for critical events, role-based access for personalized user experiences, comprehensive container management tools, data visualization for trend analysis, and geolocation tracking for enhanced logistics. Developed using .NET MAUI, the app ensures ease of use and robust functionality.

### üîë Key Features

- **Real-time Notifications:** Receive timely notifications for events such as breached thresholds and security alerts, ensuring proactive management.
- **Role-based Access:** Role-specific views and functionalities cater to both farm technicians and fleet owners, ensuring tailored experiences.
- **Container Management:** Easily display and control container security and environmental conditions, providing comprehensive oversight.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data changes over time through interactive graphs, facilitating informed decision-making and trend analysis.
- **Geolocation Tracking:** Display container geolocation for fleet owners, enhancing fleet management and logistics planning.

## üåü Bonus Features & Project Documentation
### IoT Hub Storage
- Storage Type: Blob Storage
- Reason: IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bidirectional communication between millions of IoT devices and a solution back end. It also provides a secure way to store data from IoT devices. Blob storage is a good choice for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.
